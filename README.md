# EnterTheMatrix

***Shout out to Dr. Jorge Fonseca for creating this project! I really love this especially when it goes deeper into Linked Lists data structures!***

Overview of this project:
Take down any hacker that enters the matrix. Create a 2-Dimensinal linked list that does not require any variables maintaining it’s dimensions. The linked list will contain a string in the
data component that will contain a 3 character string:

qhj rsf lwc ecs pgt ohu
bdc xax sci jjv neo msx
tgt wky qbg jpo drr hqt

This list will be randomly generated but one of the nodes will have its random string replaced by the string “neo”. This is the hacker that we must find and 
exterminate them. Once you have developed the simulation, you must create a function that will search the linked list and find
this hacker. Do two forms of searching for it. One in a sequential manner, and one in a random matter.
